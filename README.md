This is the beginning of a Sump Pump Monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi and an 
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Features I would like to add

- Monitor the water level in a sump pit
- SMS Alerts when water level reaches a certain level
- Dumping daily csv reports to a remote web server
- Remote web server graphical reporting system. Historical data.
- Calculate the volume of water being pumped per hour, day.
