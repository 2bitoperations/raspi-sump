This is the beginning of a Sump Pump Monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi and an 
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Orginal script was copied from: 
http://www.bytecreation.com/blog/2013/10/13/raspberry-pi-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04

Features I would like to add

- Monitor the water level in my sump pit
- SMS Alerts when water level reaches a certain level
- Dumping daily reports to a remote web server
- Graphing historical data


Full details once started will be posted to
